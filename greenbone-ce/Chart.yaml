  The OpenVAS and Greenbone Community Edition is a great tool for 
  Vulnerabiltiy Assesment.
 
  Currently there is a onl a docker-compose variant. This helmchart took the docker-compose file from
  https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/22.4/container/#docker-compose-file , translate it to k8s using kompose and create a helm Chart from the results.

  Goal is making it easier to consume from Kubernetes


# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.1.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
appVersion: "22.4.0"
